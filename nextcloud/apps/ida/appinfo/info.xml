        This Nextcloud app is part of the IDA research data storage service.

        IDA is organized by the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture.
        The service is produced by CSC - IT Center for Science Ltd., Espoo Finland

        The app provides functionality for selecting individual folders or files within the
        working space of a particular project and preparing them for preservation, making them
        available to other CSC data preservation services by:

        * Rendering files immutable by moving them to a protected "frozen" project space
        * Generating PIDs for each file which can be used to include files in one or more data sets
        * Generating checksums for each file
        * Storing technical metadata about each file
        * Replicating all files to ensure data integrity
        * Providing secure access to trusted CSC services

        Proper access to files, and their associated metadata, is the responsibility of
        the each trusted CSC service which is provided access to the IDA service.
