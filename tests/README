#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This subdirectory contains behavioral, integration, and end-to-end tests, and
their related utilities and resources, used to validate proper behavior and
functionality of the IDA service in a manner agnostic to its underlying 
implementation.

The organization of the test subdirectories mirror the organization of the code
in general, such that each significant component within the /ida subtree should
have a like named subdirectory with one or more tests.

    E.g. the service component     /ida/admin
    will have behavioral tests in  /ida/tests/admin

Automated tests should not leave any residue in the service. If special test
accounts, events, content, etc. are created as part of the test, they should be
removed/cleaned-up by the test script so they are not visible in the UI of the
test server (presuming that the test server being used is not instantiated and
discarded on-the-fly as part of the testing process).

Notes:

Unit tests relevant to the underlying implementation will reside within the
code subdirectory of the relevant service component.

    E.g. /ida/agents/tests 

Behavioral tests will not be created for anything residing in /ida/utils, nor
is anything in /ida/utils considered part of the production service, but are
nevertheless included in the code repository and likely will be found useful.

RUNNING TESTS

The root /ida/tests folder contains a script 'run-tests' which will locate
and run all tests, or a subset of tests, depending on the arguments provided.

Further details and examples are provided in the comments of the script.

---

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WRITING TESTS

Each logical suite of tests should be executable by providing the package path
as a single parameter to the 'run-tests' script.

During execution of the tests, each set of logically related tests should be
indicated by outputting a status line containing a heading matching the pattern
"--- Heading" (typically output as part of the setup.

Prior to each specific test assertion, operation, action, a status line should be
output containing a brief summary, describing the behavioral action being executed
(e.g. "Freeze a single file", "Retrieve the file details associated with an action",
etc. If the action should not be allowed or possible, the summary should start with
the "Attempt to", e.g "Attempt to lock service as normal user", "Attempt to unfreeze
folder while project is locked", etc.

When setting up for tests, output a status message "(initializing)". When cleaning
up after tests, output a status message "(cleaning)".

See the existing test execution for examples.

The summary of all test set headings and summaries should serve as documentation of
the functional test coverage provided by the implemented tests.
