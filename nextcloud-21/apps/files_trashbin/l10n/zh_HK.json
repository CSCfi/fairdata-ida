    "This application enables users to restore files that were deleted from the system. It displays a list of deleted files in the web interface, and has options to restore those deleted files back to the users file directories or remove them permanently from the system. Restoring a file also restores related file versions, if the versions application is enabled. When a file is deleted from a share, it can be restored in the same manner, though it is no longer shared. By default, these files remain in the trash bin for 30 days.\nTo prevent a user from running out of disk space, the Deleted files app will not utilize more than 50% of the currently available free quota for deleted files. If the deleted files exceed this limit, the app deletes the oldest files until it gets below this limit. More information is available in the Deleted Files documentation." : "此應用程式讓使用可以還原從系統中刪除的檔案。其會在網路介面中顯示已刪除的檔案列表，並有選項可以復原那些檔案到用戶的檔案目錄，或是將它們從系統中永久移除。若啟用了版本應用程式，復原檔案也會復原相關的檔案版本。當檔案從分享中刪除時，雖然不再共享，但可以用相同的方式來還原。預設情況下，這些檔案會在回收桶中保留30天。\n為了避免用戶耗盡磁碟空間，「已刪除檔案」應用程式將不會用於超過目前可用配額 50% 的已刪除檔案。如果已刪除的檔案超過此限制，應用程式將會刪除最舊的檔案，直到低於此限制為止。更多資訊在「已刪除檔案」的文件中提供。",
