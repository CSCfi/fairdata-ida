# Fairdata IDA Research Data Storage Service
 
This repository contains the latest implementation of the [Fairdata IDA service](https://ida.fairdata.fi), and
is made available under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.

Fairdata IDA is a continuous research data storage service organized by the [Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture](https://minedu.fi/en/frontpage)
and produced by [CSC - IT Center for Science Ltd., Espoo Finland](https://research.csc.fi).

The service is offered free of charge to Finnish universities and universities of applied sciences, research
institutes, as well as research funded by the Academy of Finland.

The service is intended for stable research data, both raw data and processed datasets.

IDA enables uploading, organizing, and sharing research data within a project group and storing the data in
an immutable state. The data stored in IDA can be included in research datasets which are described and made
publicly available for download via other [Fairdata services](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/).
