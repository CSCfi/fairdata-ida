The implementation of the IDA service aims to modify the Nextcloud core as little as possible, but certain
modifications are unavoidable, due to the fact that we are coercing Nextcloud to function as a group-centric
tool rather than its intended use primarily as a personal tool, in order to achieve specific UX goals.

Where possible, modifications are done using the Nextcloud theme machinery, by copying the original core file to
the IDA theme directory space using the same relative pathname and modifying the copied file accordingly. This
results in Nextcloud loading the version of the file from the theme rather than the original core file. 
e.g. /nextcloud/core/templates/layout.guest.php -> /nextcloud/themes/ida/core/templates/layout.guest.php

Note that when updating files within the IDA theme, it may be necessary to apply updates to the new original core
file not present in the modified theme file.

To review the changes made to the core files in their theme-specific variants, or to see what changes must be made
after updating to a new version, simply perform a diff of the core file in its original location and the modified
file in the theme directory space.

If a core file cannot be copied into the IDA theme directory space and must be modified in-place, in its original
location, the original file will be backed up as a copy with the filename suffix '.original'.

To review the changes made to the core files in-place, simply perform a diff of the backed up '.original' file
and the modified file with the same filename without the '.original' suffix. 

General aspects of server configuration are not covered here. Only those aspects which require addition to or
modification of the /nextcloud directory tree after updating Nextcloud.


-- INSTALLING A NEWER VERSION OF NEXTCLOUD INTO AN EXISTING IDA SERVICE

>> Execute /var/ida/utils/stop-all to halt apache and the postprocessing agents
>> Rename the existing /nextcloud directory to /nextcloud-old
>> Download and unzip the latest Nextcloud package as /nextcloud
>> Ensure the following are installed: php7*-intl php7*-pgsql php7*-zip php7*-gd
>> Copy /nextcloud-old/themes/ida to /nextcloud/themes/ida
>> Copy /nextcloud-old/apps/ida to /nextcloud/apps/ida
>> Copy /nextcloud-old/.htaccess to /nextcloud/.htaccess
>> Copy /nextcloud-old/config/config.php to /nextcloud/config/config.php
>> Edit /nextcloud/config.php to update the Nextcloud version to the newly installed version (c.f. /nextcloud/version.php)
>> Execute /var/ida/utils/restart
>> Open Nextcloud in browser, and approve the update process when prompted
>> Log in as admin and disable all apps except those listed in essential_nextcloud_apps, and disable / do not enable the IDA app
>> Run 'occ db:add-missing-indices' to fix database
>> Edit /nextcloud/config.php to define 'theme' => 'ida' (removed during update process)
>> Create new '.original' copies within /nextcloud of all modified files listed by the list-modified-files script (see below) 
>> Copy all in-place modified files from /nextcloud-old to their equivalent locations in /nextcloud
>> Restart apache
>> Log in as admin and enable IDA app
>> UPDATE ALL OF THE MODIFIED FILES AND ANY NEW FILES, AS REQUIRED, DEBUG, DEBUG, DEBUG...


-- UTILITY SCRIPTS

The utility scripts in this directory expect that the old version of nextcloud is accessible as
$ROOT/nextcloud-old and the new version of nextcloud is accessible as $ROOT/nextcloud-new, either
by renaming of directories or via symbolic links.

The list of essential Nextcloud apps which cannot be removed from the official distribution are listed in
the file essential_nextcloud_apps.

A list of modified Nextcloud files can be easily obtained with the script list-modified-files.

Diffs of all modified files in the old version of nextcloud can be generated using the script
generate-diffs, and will be stored in the ./diffs/ subdirectory by their relative pathnames.

A list of files modified in the old version of nextcloud which do not exist in the new version
of nextcloud can be obtaind via the script list-missing-new-modified-files.
